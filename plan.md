# Detailed Plan for 3-Story Building Planning Web Application

This plan outlines the creation of a Next.js–based web application that allows users to plan and visualize a 3-story building. The application features a modern, clean UI with floor selection, floor plan visualization, a project timeline, and a material estimator form for cost and material planning.

## 1. Project Structure & New Files

- **New Page**
  - **File:** `src/app/building-planner/page.tsx`
    - Create a new Next.js page for the Building Planner.
    - Import and render the main BuildingPlanner component.
    - Add appropriate `<head>` tags (title, meta) for SEO.
    - Implement error boundaries for robust page loading.

- **New Components**
  - **BuildingPlanner Component**
    - **File:** `src/components/BuildingPlanner.tsx`
    - Acts as the primary container.
    - Renders a header with the title “3-Story Building Planner” using modern typography and spacing.
    - Maintains state for the currently selected floor (1, 2, or 3).
    - Includes error handling (e.g., try/catch in event handlers) for subcomponents.

  - **FloorSelector Component**
    - **File:** `src/components/FloorSelector.tsx`
    - Displays three tabs labeled “Floor 1”, “Floor 2”, and “Floor 3” with accessible ARIA roles.
    - Uses callback props to update the selected floor in BuildingPlanner.
    - Applies modern styling with hover and active states using only typography, colors, and spacing.

  - **FloorPlan Component**
    - **File:** `src/components/FloorPlan.tsx`
    - Receives the current floor number as a prop.
    - Renders a grid layout simulating a floor plan (using CSS grid or flex layouts).
    - Includes error handling to display a user-friendly message if an invalid floor is selected.

  - **Timeline Component**
    - **File:** `src/components/Timeline.tsx`
    - Displays a horizontal project timeline with milestones and progress indicators.
    - Uses simple divs styled with modern spacing and typography.
    - Responsive design considerations to adapt to different screen sizes.

  - **MaterialEstimator Component**
    - **File:** `src/components/MaterialEstimator.tsx`
    - Provides a form (using existing UI inputs and buttons from `src/components/ui/`) for entering material details and cost calculations.
    - Includes client-side validation, error messages for invalid inputs, and a submission handler wrapped in try/catch.
    - Displays calculated estimations interactively upon form submission.

- **Styling Updates**
  - **File:** `src/app/globals.css`
    - Add custom CSS classes for new component styling.
    - Ensure modern typography, balanced colors, and adequate spacing/margins.
    - Implement responsive design rules.

- **Documentation**
  - **File:** `README.md`
    - Update the README to include new Building Planner page information.
    - Document navigation instructions (e.g., “Navigate to `/building-planner` in your browser to access the planner.”).
    - Outline testing instructions for the new components.

## 2. Implementation Steps & Error Handling

1. **Page Integration:**
   - Create `src/app/building-planner/page.tsx` to serve as the route.
   - Import BuildingPlanner and wrap with React error boundaries.

2. **BuildingPlanner Component:**
   - Initialize state (e.g., using `useState<number>(1)` for the selected floor).
   - Render header, FloorSelector, FloorPlan (passing the selected floor), Timeline, and MaterialEstimator.
   - Add conditional rendering to gracefully handle errors (e.g., missing data or unexpected floor number).

3. **FloorSelector Component:**
   - Render three clickable tabs.
   - Use proper ARIA roles for accessibility.
   - Invoke a callback to update the parent component’s state upon tab selection.
   - Implement error-bound event handlers to prevent application crashes.

4. **FloorPlan Component:**
   - Receive `floor` as a prop.
   - Use a CSS grid layout to simulate room layouts.
   - Validate the `floor` prop and show an error message for out-of-range values.

5. **Timeline & MaterialEstimator Components:**
   - Use stateless functional components to render the timeline and estimator.
   - Validate and parse user input in MaterialEstimator.
   - Wrap external operations (if any) in try/catch and display fallback messages on errors.

6. **UI/UX Considerations:**
   - Use clean, minimalist design principles with modern typography, color contrasts, and ample whitespace.
   - Ensure all interactive elements (tabs, buttons, form inputs) have clear visual feedback on hover and focus.
   - Avoid external icons or image libraries; rely solely on HTML/CSS for visuals.
   - Maintain a consistent design language across all components.

7. **Testing & Best Practices:**
   - Manually test the new page in a local development server (`npm run dev`).
   - Validate form inputs and error messages.
   - Confirm responsiveness across devices.
   - Add unit tests (if applicable) for each component with proper error boundary scenarios.

## Summary

- A new Next.js page (`/building-planner`) will serve as the entry for the 3-story building planning application.
- Key components include BuildingPlanner (main container), FloorSelector (tabs for floors), FloorPlan (grid view for each floor), Timeline (project timeline), and MaterialEstimator (cost estimator form).
- Each component will implement error handling, accessible design, and modern UI principles without external icon libraries.
- Global styles are updated in `globals.css` for modern typography and responsive layout.
- Documentation in README.md will reflect new features and testing instructions.
